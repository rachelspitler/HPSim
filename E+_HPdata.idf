!Zone Heating and Cooling Equipment are attached to zones by the following statements:

ZoneHVAC:EquipmentList,
       !extensible:4 Duplicate the four fields Zone Equipment Object Type through Heating Priority
       !List equipment in simulation order. Note that an ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit or
       !AirTerminal:SingleDuct:Uncontrolled object must be listed in this statement if there is a forced
       !air system serving the zone from the air loop.
       !Equipment is simulated in the order specified by Zone Equipment Cooling Sequence and
       !Zone Equipment Heating or No-Load Sequence, depending on the thermostat request.
       !For equipment of similar type, assign sequence 1 to the first system intended to
       !serve that type of load. For situations where one or more equipment types has limited capacity or
       !limited control, order the sequence so that the most controllable piece of equipment runs last.
       !For example, with a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), the air terminal for the DOAS should be
       !assigned Heating Sequence = 1 and Cooling Sequence = 1. Any other equipment should be assigned
       !sequence 2 or higher so that it will see the net load after the DOAS air is added to the zone.

Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System,
      !This compound object models a desiccant heat exchanger, an optional
      !heater, and associated fans. The process air stream is the air which
      !is dehumidified. The regeneration air stream is the air which is
      !heated to regenerate the desiccant. The desiccant heat exchanger
      !transfers both sensible and latent energy between the process and
      !regeneration air streams. The desiccant dehumidifier is typically used
      !in an AirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem, but can also be specified in any AirLoopHVAC.

!group Controllers
!*****************Controller****************************
! A Controller mimics the function of an actual physical controller, though it
! is somewhat more limited.  It can sense one node variable, compare it with
! its setpoint, and determine the desired value for another node variable.
!
! Rule: A Controller can not span a loop manager boundary (but a Setpoint
! Manager can). Thus in an air loop the sensed node and the controlled
! device must be in the air loop.  This means that a single zone system can
! not be modeled with a simple controller sensing zone temperature and
! controlling coil water flow.  Instead this must be modeled as a Setpoint
! Manager sensing a zone temperature and resetting the supply air temperature
! setpoint each timestep.  This is artificial but should simplify the control
! modelling task.

       !the chiller varies but the operating temperatures remain at the design values.
       !The curve is normalized so that at full load the value of the curve should be 1.0.
       !The curve is usually linear or quadratic.
 EleInCoolOutRatFunTempCurve, !Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name
       !The curve represents the fraction of the electricity to the chiller at full load as
       !it varies by temperature. The curve is normalized so that at design conditions the
       !value of the curve should be 1.0. This is a biquadratic curve with the
       !input variables being the leaving chilled water temperature and either
       !the entering or leaving condenser water temperature.
 EleInCoolOutRatFunPLRatCur, !Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name
       !The curve represents the fraction of the electricity to the chiller as the load on
       !the chiller varies but the operating temperatures remain at the design values.
       !The curve is normalized so that at full load the value of the curve should be 1.0.
       !The curve is usually linear or quadratic.
 HeatCapFunCoolCapCurve, !Heating Capacity Function of Cooling Capacity Curve Name
       !The curve represents how the heating capacity of the chiller varies with cooling
       !capacity when the chiller is simultaeous heating and cooling. The curve is normalized
       !so an input of 1.0 represents the nominal cooling capacity and an output of 1.0
       !represents the full heating capacity (see the Heating to cooling capacity ratio input)
       !The curve is usually linear or quadratic.
 FuelInHeatOutRatHeatOnlyOpCurve, !Fuel Input to Heat Output Ratio During Heating Only Operation Curve Name
       !When the chiller is operating as only a heater, this curve is used to represent the
       !fraction of fuel used as the heating load varies. It is normalized so that a value
       !of 1.0 is the full heating capacity. The curve is usually linear or quadratic and
       !will probably be similar to a boiler curve for most chillers.

        !electric demand charge is used. The baseline source variable can be the results of another ratchet 
        !object. This allows utility tariffs that have multiple ratchets to be modeled.
 AdjSourceVar,  !Adjustment Source Variable
        !The variable that the ratchet is calculated from. It is often but not always the same as the 
        !baseline source variable. The ratcheting calculations using offset and multiplier are using the

    ,  !Multiplier Value or Variable Name
        !Often the ratchet has a clause such as "the current month demand or 90% of the summer month 
        !demand". For this case a value of 0.9 would be entered here as the multiplier. This value maybe

    ;  !Offset Value or Variable Name
        !A less common strategy is to say that the ratchet must be all demand greater than a value in this 
        !case an offset that is added to the demand may be entered here. If entered it is common for the 
        !offset value to be negative representing that the demand be reduced. If no value is entered it is

       !The method of aggregation for the selected variable or meter.
       !SumOrAverage adds up the values for every timestep in the month if the variable
       !  is a sum variable. If the variable is an average variable it reports the average value.
       ! This is probably the most common Aggregation Type option to choose.
       !Maximum and Minimum find the maximum and minimum value for the month and report it
       ! along with the time that it first occurred. When Maximum or Minimum are selected a
       ! column is automatically shown in the output report for the time that it occurred.
       !When Maximum or Minimum are used with an average variable the value is divided
       ! by the length of the timestep.
       !ValueWhenMaxMin looks at the previous variable in the report that sets a maximum or minimum
       ! and displays the value of the current variable at that same timestep.
       ! Order of the variables in the report is important when using ValueWhenMaxMin.
       ! This can be used when an outdoor temperature should be reported for the time of the
       !  maximum cooling load.
       !HoursNonZero adds up the elapsed time during the month that this variable is non-zero
       !  and would be appropriate to determine the number of hour that a fan operates.
       !HoursZero - The HoursZero option adds up the elapsed time during the month that this
       !  variable has a zero value and would be appropriate to determine the number of hour
       !  that a fan does not operate.
       !HoursPositive - The HoursPositive option adds up the elapsed time during the month that
       !  this variable has a positive value. Hours with a zero value are not included.
       !HoursNonPositive - The HoursNonPositive option adds up the elaspsed time during the month
       !  that this variable has non-positive value. Hours with a negative value and hours with a
       !  zero value are all included.
       !HoursNegative - The HoursNegative option adds up the elapsed time during the month that
       !  this variable has a negative value. Hours with a zero value are not included.
       !HoursNonNegative - The HoursNonNegative option adds up the elaspsed time during the month
       !  that this variable has non-negative value. Hours with a positive value and
       !  hours with a zero value are all included.
       !SumOrAverageDuringHoursShown - Provides the sum or average of the named variable when
       !  during the hours that the previous variable displayed with any of the Aggregation Types
       !  starting with "Hours". For "sum" type variables adds up the values for each timestep
       !  and reports the sum of the value monthly during the hours reported on the previous
       !  variable. For "average" type variables, the value shown will be the average for the month
       !  during the hours reported on the previous variable. Order of the variables in
       !  the report is important when using this Aggregation Type.
       !MaximumDuringHoursShown - Reports the maximum value and the time that the maximum value
       !  occurred but only during the hours reported with the previous "hours-" Aggregation Type.
       !  When the Maximum option is used with an average variable the value is divided
       !  by the length of the timestep. Order of the variables in the report is important
       !  when using this Aggregation Type.
       !MinimumDuringHoursShown - Reports the minimum value and the time that the minimum value
       !  occurred but only during the hours reported with the previous "hours-" Aggregation Type.
       !  When the Minimum option is used with an average variable the value is divided
       !  by the length of the timestep. Order of the variables in the report is important
       !  when using this Aggregation Type.
